Lately we’ve heard exciting things about how God is multiplying the progress of Bible translation throughout the world.
- “**God is on the move**, and His Spirit is being poured out in ways that we’ve never experienced before.”* 
- “All around the world, **Bible translation is growing exponentially**,” far beyond expectations. 
- “**People are encountering Jesus** as they receive Scripture in a language and format they clearly understand.”
- Yet “the **remaining languages** that don’t have God’s Word today are unreached for a reason; they’re the hardest of the hard places.”

Wycliffe, along with other Bible translation partners, is striving toward the goal that a Bible translation project will be in progress for every people group that needs it by the year 2025. The map below shows the languages in each country that are still waiting for translation work to begin.

There are 7,388 total languages in the world.

You who pray for us or partner with us financially are a part of this work! You play a role in declaring God’s name among the nations. You can rejoice and celebrate that God is doing amazing things around the world through his global Church as He calls people by name and invites them into a relationship with Him. We are grateful for your participation with us in the ministry of Bible translation. 

You are enabling us to continue in our roles – Carol Jean on the Mobilization team and Steve as a translation consultant. Thank you!

Praise God…
- For the dramatic increase of Bible translation work by many organizations around the world, often initiated by the local people themselves.
- That God’s Word brings salvation and transformation in people’s lives.
- That Carol Jean’s mom is recovering after her knee replacement surgery.

Please pray for…
- God to bring about Bible translations for every language that needs it. 
- Lives to be transformed as people encounter God through His Word.
- Wisdom for Wycliffe’s leaders as they continually seek to align with what God is doing around the world.
- The mobilization team Carol Jean is on as they transition through a departmental reorganization.
- More people to join the mobilization and recruitment teams, which reach out to people God wants to use in the ministry of Bible translation. 
- Steve to continue making progress in developing the Translator’s Notes resource on Exodus.
