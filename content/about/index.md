## About Us

Steve and Carol Jean Gallagher have a passion for Godâ€™s Word to reach people in the languages that speak to their hearts. Their involvement in Bible translation for 27 years in Papua New Guinea has prepared them well for their current roles.

As a translation consultant, Steve helps ensure the quality of translated Scriptures in languages of PNG and other countries. Carol Jean provides practical support for the Wycliffe mobilization team as they invite the next generation of missionaries to serve in the work of Bible translation.

Please consider how you might partner with them in their Wycliffe ministry financially or in prayer.
